RoboVM Gradle plugin
====================

# Usage
To use the RoboVM plugin, include in your build script:

```groovy
// Pull the plugin from Maven Central
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
        maven { url 'https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots' }
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'org.robovm:robovm-gradle-plugin:1.0.0'
    }
}

// Apply the plugin
apply plugin: 'robovm'

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    maven { url 'https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots' }
}

ext {
    // Configure your application main class
    mainClassName = "org.robovm.sample.ios.RoboVMSampleIOSApp"
    roboVMVersion = "1.0.0"
}

robovm {
    // Configure robovm
    iosSignIdentity = ""
    iosProvisioningProfile = ""
    iosSkipSigning = false
    stdoutFifo = ""
    stderrFifo = ""
}
```

## Tasks

The RoboVM plugin defines the following tasks:

* `launchIPhoneSimulator`: Runs Your iOS App in the iPhone Simulator.
* `launchIPadSimulator`: Runs Your iOS App in the iPad Simulator.
* `launchIOSDevice`: Runs Your iOS App in the iOS Device.
* `launchConsole`: Runs a Console App.
* `createIPA`: Creates .ipa file. This is an alias for the `robovmArchive` task.
* `robovmArchive`: Compiles a binary,a rchives it in a format suitable for distribution and saves it to `build/robovm/`.
* `robovmInstall`: Compiles a binary and installs it to `build/robovm/`.

## Project properties

The iOS Simulator launcher properties can be set by project properties via `gradle.properties` or `-P` command line parameter:

* `robovm.device.name`: Set the device name property.
 * iPhone-4s: iPhone 4S
 * iPhone-5: iPhone 5
 * iPhone-5s: iPhone 5S
 * iPhone-6: iPhone 6
 * iPhone-6-Plus: iPhone 6 Plus
 * iPad-2: iPad 2
 * iPad-Retina: iPad Retina
 * iPad-Air: iPad Air
 * Resizable-iPhone: Resizable iPhone
 * Resizable-iPad: Resizable iPad
* `robovm.sdk.version`: Set the sdk version property.

The arch can be specified using the `gradle.properties` or `-P` command line parameter. To launch on the simulator in 64-bit mode use:

```
gradle -Probovm.arch=x86_64 -Probovm.device.name=iPhone-5s launchIPhoneSimulator
```

Make sure to specify a 64-bit capable device type to simulate, e.g. `iPhone-5s`.

To launch on device in 64-bit mode:

```
gradle -Probovm.arch=arm64 launchIOSDevice
```

The `robovmArchive` task will by default include the archs listed in the `robovm.xml` file in the archive. Use the `robovm.archs` property to specify the archs to include in the archive:

```
gradle -Probovm.archs=thumbv7:arm64 robovmArchive
```

The `createIPA` task is an alias for the `robovmArchive` task.

The `robovmInstall` task is very similar to the `robovmArchive` task but doesn't archive the folder structure it creates. It also supports the `robovm.archs` property:

```
gradle -Probovm.archs=x86:x86_64 robovmInstall
```

## Debugging
You can instruct the RoboVM Gradle plugin to compile and run your app in debug mode:

```
gradle -Probovm.debug=true -Probovm.debugPort=7777 launchIPhoneSimulator
```

You can then attach a debugger, e.g. the Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA debugger via a remote run configuration. Simply set the host to `localhost` and the port to what you specified via `-Probovm.debugPort` (7777 in the case above).

## Plugin Development
To debug the plugin, build and install it to your local repository. Next, set `GRADLE_OPTS` as follows:

```bash
export GRADLE_OPTS="-Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=5006"
```
You can now fire up a Gradle build for some test project. Gradle will wait for a JDWP debugger to attach. You can do so in Eclipse or Intellij IDEA.

Note: if your test project uses the Gradle daemon, you have to disable it. Also, if you have a gradle.properties file specifying JVM arguments, Gradle will spawn a new JVM. You can remove/rename the gradle.properties file while debugging.
